## Definitions

TID_ID - TID means Task Id on Azure Devops. For example, I have a task that has id 1023. I should use TID_1023 in my commit headers.

type - It has various kind of types. However, we use mainly feat, fix, refactor and chore. 
  - feat = introduces a new feature to the codebase
  - fix = patches a bug in your codebase
  - refactor = improving the internal structure of an existing program's source code, while preserving its external behavior
  - chore = updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
